      <h3>Notes</h3>
      <p>
        You can use store-bought roasted chili oil, or make your own by toasting
        a cup of whole hot dried Chinese peppers in a wok until lightly charred,
        then adding 1 1/2 cups of vegetable or canola oil. Heat the oil until
        the chilis start to bubble slightly, then allow to cool and transfer to
        a sealable container. Chili oil will stay good in the refrigerator for
        several months.

        I usually use freshly ground pepper rather than go through steps 1 & 2
        and simply add it to the cooking ground beef
