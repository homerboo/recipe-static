        <h3>Directions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>For the ribs:</strong> Remove the membrane by working a butter knife between the membrane and the bone, then grab with a paper towel and pull the membrane off of the ribs. (If it tears while youâ€™re pulling, work the knife under the remaining pieces and pull them off as well.</li>
        <li><strong>For the rub:</strong> Ensure any clumps of brown sugar is broken up</li>
        <li><strong>Season the ribs and put them in the pressure cooker:</strong> Sprinkle both sides of the ribs with the salt and rub. Cut the ribs into 4 pieces, cutting between every fourth bone.</li>
        <li><strong>Pressure cook the ribs:</strong> Pour 1/2 cup of water into the pressure cooker pot (or use the minimum liquid amount for your pressure cooker). Stack the ribs in the pressure cooker bone side down. Lock the pressure cooker and pressure cook on high for 30 minutes in an electric PC (or 24 minutes in a stovetop PC), then let the pressure come down naturally, about 15 more minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Sauce and broil the ribs:</strong> Put the ribs, bone side down, on a rimmed baking sheet. Brush the ribs with the barbecue sauce, then put under a broiler set to high. Broil the ribs until the sauce is bubbling and just starting to brown, about 5 minutes. Remove the ribs from the broiler, brush with another layer of sauce, and serve.
        </li>
      </ol>
