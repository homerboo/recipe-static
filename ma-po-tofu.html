      <h3>Directions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Heat half of sichuan peppercorns in a large wok over high heat until
          lightly smoking. Transfer to a mortar and pestle. Pound until finely
          ground and set aside
        </li>
        <li>
          Add remaining sichuan peppercorns and vegetable oil to wok. Heat over
          medium high heat until lightly sizzling, about 1 1/2 minutes. Pick up
          peppercorns with a wire mesh skimmer and discard, leaving oil in pan.
        </li>
        <li>
          Combine corn starch and cold water in a small bowl and mix with a fork
          until homogenous.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bring a medium saucepan of water to a boil over high heat and add
          tofu. Cook for 1 minute. Drain in a colander, being careful not to
          break up the tofu.
        </li>
        <li>
          Heat oil in wok over high heat until smoking. Add beef and cook,
          stirring constantly for 1 minute.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add garlic and ginger and cook until fragrant, about 15 seconds.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add chili-bean paste, wine, soy sauce, and chicken stock and bring to
          a boil.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pour in corn starch mixture and cook for 30 seconds until thickened.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add tofu and carefully fold in, being careful not to break it up too
          much.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stir in chili oil and half of scallions and simmer for 30 seconds
          longer.
        </li>
        <li>
          Transfer immediately to a serving bowl and sprinkle with remaining
          scallions and toasted ground Sichuan pepper. Serve immediately with
          white rice.
        </li>

      <h3>Notes</h3>
      <p>
        You can use store-bought roasted chili oil, or make your own by toasting
        a cup of whole hot dried Chinese peppers in a wok until lightly charred,
        then adding 1 1/2 cups of vegetable or canola oil. Heat the oil until
        the chilis start to bubble slightly, then allow to cool and transfer to
        a sealable container. Chili oil will stay good in the refrigerator for
        several months.
      </p>
      <p>
        I usually use freshly ground pepper rather than go through steps 1 & 2
        and simply add it to the cooking ground beef
