      <h3>Notes</h3>
      <p>Refrigerate for up to 1 week or freeze in sealed containers for up to 6 months</p>
      <p>I prefer charring the split onion separately with a cast iron pan before step 4</p>
      <p>To reheat, warm very gently in a saucepan with 1/2 cup water, stirring until it all melts and heats through</p>
